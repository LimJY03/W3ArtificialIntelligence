## **01. What is AI?**

Artificial Intelligence is a contrast to Human Intelligence.

### **What is Artificial Intelligence?**

Artificial Intelligence suggests that machines can mimic humans in:

* Talking
* Thinking
* Learning
* Planning
* Understanding

Artificial Intelligence is also called Machine Intelligence and Computer Intelligence.

**w3schools.com Definition of AI**
> Artificial intelligence is a system that can solve a problem optimally. This means that the system can figure out alone what is the best action to take.

**Wikipedia Definition of AI**
> AI is intelligence demonstrated by machines, unlike natural intelligence displayed by humans and animals, which involves consciousness and emotionality.

**Investopedia Definition of AI**
> AI refers to the simulation of human intelligence in machines that are programmed to think like humans and mimic their actions.

**Britannica Definition of AI**
> AI is the ability of a digital computer or computer-controlled robot to perform tasks commonly associated with intelligent beings. The term is frequently applied to the project of developing systems endowed with the intellectual processes characteristic of humans, such as the ability to reason, discover meaning, generalize, or learn from past experience.

### **Why AI Now?**

One of the greatest innovators in the field of machine learning was John McCarthy, widely recognized as the "Father of Artificial Intelligence".

In the mid 1950s, McCarthy coined the term "Artificial Intelligence" and defined it as "the science of making intelligent machines".

The algorithms has been here since then. AI is more interesting now because:

* Computing power has not been strong enough
* Computer storage has not been large enough
* Big data has not been available
* Fast Internet has not been available

Another strong force is the major investments from big companies (Google, Microsoft, Facebook, YouTube) because their datasets became much too big to handle traditionally.

### **Intelligent Decision Formula**

* Save the result of all actions
* Simulate all possible outcomes
* Compare the new action with the old ones
* Check if the new action is good or bad
* Choose the new action if it is less bad
* Do it all over again

The fact that computers can do this millions of times, has proven that computers can take very intelligent decisions.

## **02. Human Intelligence**

About 70 000 years ago, something happened to the human brain.

Humans started to develop "Cognitive Intelligence":

* Being able to understand a language
* Being able to understand numbers
* Being able to understand abstract thinking

### **Words and Numbers**

Using words, was a big step in the development of human intelligence:
> "Elephant" is more informative than "Big Animal".

Understanding numbers, was also a big step:
> "5" or "50" is more informative than "few" or "many".

### **Languages**

Having a language is probably a key characteristic that distinguishes us from animals.
> "There is a lion behind the big oak" is more informative than shouting "Danger!".

### **Abstract Thinking**

Abstract thinking is the thinking about things that are not concrete, like freedom, or ideas, or concepts.

> **CONCRETE**
> * Mouth
> * Fingertip
> * One apple
> * Two chicken
> * Three horses

> **ABSTRACT**
> * Freedom
> * The past
> * The future
> * Imagination
> * Explanation

Many everyday behaviors use abstract thinking:

* Using Concepts
* Using Theories
* Using Metaphors
* Using Analogies
* Using Imagination

### **What is Intelligence?**

There is no proven definition of Intelligence.

Intelligence can be defined as:

* Being able to understand abstract thinking
* Being able to understand a language
* Being able to understand numbers

Intelligence can be defined as a collection of knowledge:

> *"Intelligence could be defined as the process of obtaining knowledge by efficient means."*
> 
> Yampolsky (2013)

The challenge of AI is to understand what intelligence is, and how intelligence works.

Intelligence might be a type of algorithms in our brains or in our genes.

### **Is the Human Brain Superior?**

Can animals, birds, insects, or plants think?

Humans have bigger brains than animals.

Big dogs have bigger brains than small dogs. Are big dogs smarter?

Birds have very small brains, but they know they should not make children in the autumn, and they know when to fly to the south.

Bees have even smaller brains, but they know how to communicate about where to find nectar.

Plants have no brain, but they know how to reproduce, and how to prepare for the winter.

---

## **03. The History of Languages**

A language is a structured system of communication that involves the use of words.

### **What is a Language**

* Apes and Whales communicate with each other.
* Birds and Bees communicate with each other.
* But only humans have developed a real Language.

No other species can express ideas using sentences constructed by a set of words (with verbs and nouns).

This skill is remarkable. And what is even more remarkable: Even children master this skill.

### **Spoken Language**

We are not sure of how old the spoken language is. The topic is difficult to study because of the lack of evidence.

We don't know how it started. But we have a clue.

> The great African apes, Pan and Gorilla, are our closest living relatives. Why are they called "Apes"? Because they ape. Apes mime to get their message across.

It is assumed that the evolution of languages must have been a long process. Our ancestors might have started speaking a million years ago, but with fewer words, more miming, and no grammar.

### **Cognitive Development**

According to [Hauser, Chomsky, and Fitch (2002)](https://www.science.org/doi/abs/10.1126/science.298.5598.1569), there are six aspects of language development:

* Theory of Mind
* Understanding Vocal Signals
* Understanding Imitation
* Understanding Numbers
* Understanding Intentional Communication
* Understanding Non-linguistic Representations

### **Human Languages**

Human languages contain a limited set of **Words** put together in **Sentences**:
> `[EN]` I'm going on holiday in my new car.
>
> `[IT]` Vado in vacanza con la mia macchina nuova.
> 
> `[ES]` Me voy de vacaciones en mi auto nuevo.
> 
> `[DE]` Ich fahre mit meinem neuen Auto in den Urlaub.

### **Computer Languages**

Computers are programmed with a limited set of Words put together in computer Statements:

```js
var points = [40, 100, 1, 5, 25, 10];
points.sort(function(a, b){return a - b});
```

### **Written Languages**

Egyptian (3000 BC) and Sumerian (3500 BC) are the earliest known written languages.

The oldest written language still in use today, is Chinese (1500 BC - now).

## **04. The History of Numbers**

To understand AI, it is important to understand the concept of Numbers and Counting.

### **AI is About Numbers**

Artificial Intelligence is all about Numbers.

Numbers are easy to understand: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 ... 11, 12, 13, 14, 15.

Studies of animals indicates that even animals can understand some numbers:

* 2 Parents
* 8 Childrens
* 5 Eggs

The need for numbers in the modern world is absolute. We cannot live without numbers:

* 100 Dollar
* Pi = 3.14
* 365 Days
* 25 Years
* 20% Tax
* 100 Miles

### **AI is About Counting**

The concept of numbers leads to the concept of counting.

Imagine prehistoric thinking:

* How to count apples?
* How to weigh corn?
* How to pay?
* How far is the ocean?

Artificial Intelligence is a result of the human need for calculations.

Counting is easy to understand: 2 + 2 = 4.

Studies of animals indicates that animals can only understand very simple counting.

How do Homo Sapiens deal with calculations?

Complex calculations are done by computers.
> Computers can be smarter than humans. 

### **Two Babylonian Scientists**

About 6000 years ago, two Babylonian scientists were talking:

> Scientist 1: "We need to invent a number system."
>
> Scientist 2: "What?"
>
> Scientist 1: "We need to give every number a name."
>
> Scientist 2: "You mean like 1, 2, and 3?"
> 
> Scientist 1: "Exactly!"
>
> Scientist 2: "But why?"
> 
> Scientist 1: "How can I tell you I have 7 sons, if you don't know what 7 is?"
> 
> Scientist 2: "Every number should have a name?"
>
> Scientist 1: "Exactly!"
>
> Scientist 2: "So, how many numbers do we need? 15?"
>
> Scientist 1: "More. Some people have more than 15 sons."
>
> Scientist 2: "Ok. 30 then. Just to be sure."
> 
> Scientist 1: "But people older than 30 should be able to tell their age."
> 
> Scientist 2: "Ok. 60 then."

### **Babylonian Numbers (Base 60)**

We believe that the Babylonians started the development of complex counting.

![Babylonian Numerals](https://www.w3schools.com/ai/img_babylonian_numerals.jpg)

The Babylonian number system has 60 different digits. It is a Base 60 system:

> 1, 5 means 1 * 60 + 5 * 1 = 65
> 
> 3, 30 means 3 * 60 + 30 * 1 = 210

The Babylonians had a place-value system, where the digits to in the left represented full values, much like our decimal system.

The reason why the Babylonians used 60 as the base, was (we like to believe) that 60 is divisible with most numbers: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 10, 12, 15, 20, 30 and 60.

The downside was that the user had to remember 60 different digits. But the system was smart. A lot of it is still in use today:
> 1 hour: 1 * 60 = 60 minutes

### **Sexagesimal (Base 60)**

The origin of the **Sexagesimal system (base 60)** has been lost in history.

But surely, it looks like it has been used in parallel with the **Dozenal system (Base 12)** since ancient times.

The sexagesimal system (base 60):

* There are 60 seconds in one minute
* There are 60 minutes in one hour

60 is very versatile. It can be divided by 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 10, 12, 15, 30 and 60.

### **Dozenal (Base 12)**

The dozenal system (base 12):

* There are 12 in a dozen
* There are 12 hours in a day
* There are 12 hours in a night
* There are 12 months in a year

12 is very versatile. It can be divided by 1, 2, 3, 4, 6 and 12.

### **Roman Numbers (Base 10)**

Roman numbers originated in Rome and was used in Europe into the Middle Ages.

> `I` -> 1
> 
> `V` -> 5
> 
> `X` -> 10
> 
> `L` -> 50
> 
> `C` -> 100
> 
> `D` -> 500
> 
> `M` -> 1000

The Romans used a Base 10 system. Possibly because they used their 10 fingers to count.

Today, most of the world use a Base 10 number system:
> Western numbers, Chinese numbers, Brahmi numbers, Greek numbers, Hebrew numbers...

### **Digital Numbers**

Humans can count with base 10 numbers, computers can not.

Electricity cannot count. Electricity can only be On and Off.

Computers use Electricity or Magnetism to represent On and Off.

> Computers use Digital Numbers like 11100110 (in contrast to Base 10 Numbers like 230).

Digital numbers (11100110) are also called Binary Numbers.

### **Computer vs. Human**

Computers can handle an unlimited amount of numbers. But, humans can not.

## **05. The History of Computing**

### **The First Abacus**

The Babylonian Abacus was developed to **Reduce the Time** to perform calculations.

As stated in the previous chapter, we believe that the Babylonians invented complex counting.

The period 2700–2300 BC probably saw the first appearance of an abacus, a table of successive columns which defined the orders of a 60-digits number system.

### **Abacus 2.0**

The Roman Abacus used 10-digits Roman numbers to **Reduce the Time** to perform calculations:

![Abacus 2.0](https://www.w3schools.com/ai/img_roman_abacus.jpg)

The Romans developed the Roman Abacus, a portable, base-10 version of earlier abacuses used by the Babylonians.

This was the worlds first handheld computer. Used by Roman engineers, merchants and tax collectors.

### **Analog Computers**

**The Difference Engine** (Charles Babbage 1822) was a mechanical machine designed to **Reduce the Time** to calculate complex mathematical functions.

**The Analytical Engine** (Charles Babbage 1833) was a mechanical machine designed with modern computer elements like arithmetic, logic and memory.

Both of these "computers" used 10-digits (decimal) mechanical cogwheels to perform mathematical calculations.

![Charles Babbage's Analytical Engine. Science Museum. London](https://www.w3schools.com/ai/img_analytical_machine.jpg)

### **Digital Computers**

Digital Computers use 0 / 1 switches to perform calculations. They operate on binary values like 11100110 in contrast to analog values like 230.

The first Electric Digital Computer was designed and built by Konrad Zuse in Germany (1941).

It used 2600 electrical relays as 0 / 1 switches. The clock speed was about 5 Hz.

![Replica of the Zuse Z3. Deutsches Museum. Munich.](https://www.w3schools.com/ai/img_z3_zuse.jpg)

### **Electronic Computers**

First Generation Computers (1945-1950) used vacuum tubes as binary switches.

> Vacuum tubes are much faster than electrical relays.
> 
> The clock speed of these computers was between 500 KHz and 1 Mhz.
> 
> ![First Generation Computers](https://www.w3schools.com/ai/img_vacuum_tubes.jpg)

Second generation Computers (1950-1960) used transistors as binary 0 / 1 switches.

> Transistors are much faster than vacuum tubes.
>
> ![Second Generation Computers](https://www.w3schools.com/ai/img_computer_transistors.jpg)

Third generation Computers (1960) used integrated circuits as binary switches.

> Integrated circuits are much faster than transistors.
>
> ![Third Generation Computers](https://www.w3schools.com/ai/img_integrated_circuits.jpg)

### **Computer Speed**

The first electrical computer could do 5 instructions per second.

The first electronic computer did 5000 instructions per second.

The first PC did 5 million instructions per second.

AMD was the first PC to reach 1 billion instructions per second.

Today, IPhone 12 can do 11 billion instructions per second.

### **Where Did it Start and Where Will it End?**

From the history above you can extract:

* Computers were designed to do calculations
* Charles Babbage created the first mechanical computer
* The first digital computers used electromechanical switches
* Vacuum tubes are much faster than electromechanical switches
* Transistors are much faster than vacuum tubes
* Integrated circuits are much faster than transistors
* Tomorrow's computes will be faster than the human brain?

> *"Computers are useless because they can only give you answers."*
>
> Pablo Picasso

### **Computers are Smarter than Humans?**

If we believe in [Moores Law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moore%27s_law):

In 2020, computers have the capacity of a mouse brain.

In 2030, computers might have the capacity of a human brain:

## **06. Robots**

### **Industrial Robots**

Industrial robots have been around for more than 50 years.

The first robot patent was applied for in 1954 and granted in 1961.

In 1969, Victor Scheinman invented the **Stanford Arm** (Stanford University), and in 1972 he designed the **MIT Arm** for the MIT Artificial Intelligence Lab.

![](https://www.w3schools.com/ai/img_mit_arm.jpg)

These "robots" are not considered intelligent. They are electrical machines designed to permit 6-axis arm movement. But the new design allowed for a machine to follow a programmed path and opened up for "robot jobs" like car painting, welding and assembly.

PUMA (Programmable Universal Machine for Assembly), a robot arm designed by Prof. Victor Scheinman and developed by Vicarm, Unimation with support from General Motors in 1978, was used in assembly lines and is still used by researchers today.

**Most industrial robots are non-intelligent.**
> 
> Most modern robots are said to be autonomous or semi-autonomous because they do not require much human input after they have been programmed.
> 
> A robot can be easily programmed to do a lot of different things (like on an assembly line), but it will never change what it is doing. It will continue to do the same job until you turn it off.

**Robots and Artificial Intelligence are two different things.**

> Robot technology is not a subset of Artificial Intelligence.
>
> A robot is a physical thing. After 50 years of development, almost anything is programmable, your radio, your watch, your phone, and even robots.

### **AI Robots**

Artificial Intelligence can be built into robots, and AI is a very exciting field in future robotics.

Hanson Robotics' Sophia personifies some dreams for the future of AI.

Sophia is a combination of science, engineering, and artistry. She is a human-crafted science fiction character depicting the future of AI and robotics.

![Sophia](https://www.w3schools.com/ai/img_sophiarobot.gif)

### **Can AI Robots Interact Socially?**

Yes, AI Robots can learn to interact socially.

Kismet (a MIT robot) is programmed to understand body language and voice inflection. The creators study how human and babies interact, based on tone of speech and visual cue.

Kismet could be the foundation of a human-like learning system.

The military uses drones today.

Tomorrow AI will replace the pilots of cargo planes.

Passenger planes will have only one pilot. The second pilot will be an autopilot.

### **Drivers and Other Transportation Jobs**

> 69% of all Taxi Drivers
> 
> 69% of all Truck Drivers
> 
> 67% of all Bus Drivers

Self-driving cars is already a reality.

The potential of jobs lost is staggering.

Very soon AI could replace millions of transportation jobs.

### **Robots Could Take 20 Million Jobs by 2030**

According to a study from [Oxford Economics](https://www.oxfordeconomics.com/) (2019), there could be 14 million robots working in China by 2030.

### **Artificial Music Intelligence**

Can an algorithm compose better music than a human?

David Cope is a former professor of music at the University of Santa Cruz (California).

For over 30 years, David Cope has been developing Emmy or EMI (Experimental Musical Intelligence), an algorithm to compose music in the style of famous composers.

> ### **Bach, Larson or EMI?**
> 
> In a test performed by professor Douglas Hofstadter of the University of Oregon, a pianist performed three musical pieces in the style of Bach:
> 
> * One written by Bach
> * One written by Steve Larson
> * One written by EMI
>
> Dr. Larson was hurt when the audience concluded that his piece was written by EMI.
> 
> He felt better when the listeners decided that the piece composed by EMI was a genuine Bach.

### **Artificial Health Intelligence**

> The **Corona Pandemic** pushed the need for optimizing **Medical Healthcare**.

Machine learning is a new technology that can provide better drug discovery, shorter development time, and lower drug costs.

Machine learning enables healthcare to use "big data" for making better medical or clinical decisions.

### **Project Baseline**

[Project Baseline](https://www.projectbaseline.com/) is an initiative to make it easy for everyone to contribute to the map of human health and to participate in clinical research.

In Project Baseline, researchers, clinicians, engineers, designers, advocates, and volunteers, can collaborate in building the next generation of healthcare tools and services.

### **FDA Statement on AI**

Statement from FDA Commissioner Scott Gottlieb, M.D. on steps towards a new, tailored review framework for artificial intelligence-based medical devices:

> *"Artificial intelligence and machine learning have the potential to fundamentally transform the delivery of health care. As technology and science advance, we can expect to see earlier disease detection, more accurate diagnosis, more targeted therapies and significant improvements in personalized medicine".*

---

## **09. Theory of Mind**

> The human mind can process:
> 
> * Thoughts
> * Feelings
> * Emotions
> * Self Awareness
> * Empathy

### **What is Mind**

There is **no** proven definition of "Mind".

Mind can be defined as an instantiation of intelligence, or as a collection of knowledge.

> Is the **Mind** just a big computer?

### **Cognitive Science**

Cognitive science is the study of **mind processes**.

A cognitive scientist studies intelligence and behavior.

Cognitive science focus on how brain cells process and transform information.

Cognitive Science also tries to learn how to develop intelligent computer algorithms.

> Cognitive Science links the 6 elements together:
> 
> 1. Philosophy
> 2. Psychology
> 3. Linguistic
> 4. Anthropology
> 5. Neuroscience
> 6. Artificial Intelligence

### **The Mental Model**

A mental model is an internal picture of the external reality.

Scientists expects that a model plays a major role in reasoning and decision-making (cognition).

Kenneth Craik suggested in 1943 that the mind constructs "small-scale models" of reality when trying to anticipate events.

> *The image of the world around us, which we carry in our head, is just a model. Nobody in his head imagines all the world, government or country. He has only selected concepts, and relationships between them, and uses those to represent the real system.*
> 
> Jay Wright Forrester, 1971.

### **Can AI be Human?**

Scientists are trying to discover what separates human intelligence from artificial intelligence.

What is the status? What is the future?

* Year 2000: **Reactive Machines**
* Year 2015: **Machine Learning**
* Year 2030: **Theory of Mind**
* Year 2050: **Self-Awareness**

> **01. REACTIVE MACHINES**
> 
> Early AI systems were reactive. Reactive systems cannot use past experience.
> 
> In 1997 a reactive machine ("IBM Deep Blue") beat the world champion in chess.
> 
> "Deep Blue" could not think. But it was stored with information about the chess board, and the rules for moving chess pieces.
> 
> "Deep Blue" won because it was programmed to calculate every move to win.
> 
> ![Deep Blue](https://www.w3schools.com/ai/img_chess.jpg)

> **02. MACHINE LEARNING**
> 
> Today, AI systems can use some information from the past.
> 
> One example is self-driven cars. They can combine pre-programmed information with information they collect while they learn how to drive.

> **03. THEORY OF MIND**
> 
> **Theory of Mind** is a term from psychology about an individual's capacity for empathy and understanding of others.
> 
> This is an awareness of others being like yourself, with individual needs and intentions.
> 
> One of the abilities language users have, is to communicate about things that are not concrete, like needs, ideas, or concepts.
> 
> Simon Baron-Cohen, British psychologist and professor at the University of Cambridge (1999), argues  that "Theory of Mind" must have preceded languages, based on knowledges about early human activities:
> 
> * Teaching
> * Building Shared Goals
> * Building Shared Plans
> * Intentional Communication
> * Intentional Sharing of Topic
> * Intentional Sharing of Focus
> * Intentional Persuasion
> * Intentional Pretending
> * Intentional Deception

> **04. SELF AWARENESS**
> 
> In psychology, "Theory of Mind" means that people have thoughts, feelings and emotions that affect their behavior.
> 
> Future AI systems must learn to understand that everyone (both people and AI objects) have thoughts and feelings.
> 
> They must know how to adjust their behavior to be able to walk among us.
>
> The last step, before AI can be human, is machine consciousness.
> 
> We cannot construct this software before we know much more about the human brain, memory and intelligence.

## **10. AI Programming**

> Programming languages involved in Artificial Intelligence are:
> 
> * LISP
> * R
> * Python
> * C++
> * Java
> * JavaScript
> * SQL

### **Language Ranking for AI Programming**

![Language Ranking for AI Programming](https://www.w3schools.com/ai/img_languages_2020.jpg)

Source: [Octoverse](https://octoverse.github.com/)

### **LISP**

LISP is the second oldest programming language in the world (1958), only one year younger than Fortran (1957).

The term **Artificial Intelligence** was made up by John McCarthy who invented LISP.

LISP was founded on the theory of **Recursive Functions** (a function appears in its own definition).

Recursive Functions can be written as self-modifying functions, and this is very suitable for AI programs where "self-learning" is an important part of the program.

### **R**

R is a programming language for **Graphics** and **Statistical** computing.

R is supported by the [R Foundation for Statistical Computing](https://www.r-project.org/).

R comes with a wide set of statistical and graphical techniques for:

* Linear Modeling
* Nonlinear Modeling
* Statistical Tests
* Time-series Analysis
* Classification
* Clustering

### **Python**

Python is a general-purpose coding language. It can be used for all types of programming and software development.

Python is typically used for server development, like building web apps for web servers.

Python is also typically used in **Data Science**.

An advantage for using Python is that it comes with some very suitable libraries:

* NumPy (Library for working with Arrays)
* SciPy (Library for Statistical Science)
* Matplotlib (Graph Plotting Library)
* NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit)
* TensorFlow (Machine Learning)

### **C++**

C++ holds the title: "The worlds fastest programming language".

> Because of the speed, C++ is a preferred language when programming Computer Games.
> 
> It provides faster execution and has less response time which is applied in search engines and development of computer games.

Google uses C++ in AI programs for SEO (Search Engine Optimization).

**SHARK** is a super-fast library with support for supervised learning algorithms, linear regression, neural networks, and clustering.

**MLPACK** is a super-fast machine learning library written for C++.

### **Java**

Java is another general-purpose coding language that can be used for all types of software development.

For AI, Java is mostly used to create machine learning solutions, search algorithms, and neural networks.

### **JavaScript**

Most Artificial Intelligence applications uses R or Python.

But these days, several JavaScript AI framework are emerging.

JavaScript frameworks make it possible to execute AI tasks in the browser.

> **WebGL API**
> 
> WebGL is a JavaScript API for rendering 2D and 3D graphics in any browser.
> 
> WebGL can run on both integrated and standalone graphic cards in any PC.
> 
> WebGL brings 3D graphics to the web browser. Major browser vendors Apple (Safari), Google (Chrome), Microsoft (Edge), and Mozilla (Firefox) are members of the WebGL Working Group.
> 
> WebGL 1.0 was released in March 2011.
> 
> WebGL 2.0 was released in January 2017.

> **NEURAL NETWORK WITH JS**
>
> Artificial Intelligence can be math-heavy. The nature of neural networks is highly technical, and the jargon that goes along with it tends to scare people away.
>
> This is where JavaScript can come to help. We need easy-to-understand software APIs to simplifying the process of creating and training neural networks.



### **SQL**

SQL (Structured Query Language) is the most popular language for managing data.

Knowledge of SQL databases, tables and queries helps data scientists when dealing with data.

SQL is very convenient for storing, manipulating, and retrieving data in databases.

### **Math in the Browser**

Math.js is an extensive math library for JavaScript and Node.js.

Math.js is powerful and easy to use. It comes with a large set of built-in functions, a flexible expression parser, and solutions to work with many data types like numbers, big numbers, complex numbers, fractions, units, arrays, and matrices.

### **Machine Learning in the Browser**

Brain.js is a GPU accelerated neural networks in JavaScript for Browsers and Node.js.

Brain.js is simple to use. You do not need to know neural networks in details to work with Brain.js.

Brain.js provides multiple neural network implementations as different neural nets can be trained to do different things well.
