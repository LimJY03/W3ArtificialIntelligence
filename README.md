## **01 What is AI?**

Artificial Intelligence is a contrast to Human Intelligence.

### **What is Artificial Intelligence?**

Artificial Intelligence suggests that machines can mimic humans in:

* Talking
* Thinking
* Learning
* Planning
* Understanding

Artificial Intelligence is also called Machine Intelligence and Computer Intelligence.

**w3schools.com Definition of AI**
> Artificial intelligence is a system that can solve a problem optimally. This means that the system can figure out alone what is the best action to take.

**Wikipedia Definition of AI**
> AI is intelligence demonstrated by machines, unlike natural intelligence displayed by humans and animals, which involves consciousness and emotionality.

**Investopedia Definition of AI**
> AI refers to the simulation of human intelligence in machines that are programmed to think like humans and mimic their actions.

**Britannica Definition of AI**
> AI is the ability of a digital computer or computer-controlled robot to perform tasks commonly associated with intelligent beings. The term is frequently applied to the project of developing systems endowed with the intellectual processes characteristic of humans, such as the ability to reason, discover meaning, generalize, or learn from past experience.

### **Why AI Now?**

One of the greatest innovators in the field of machine learning was John McCarthy, widely recognized as the "Father of Artificial Intelligence".

In the mid 1950s, McCarthy coined the term "Artificial Intelligence" and defined it as "the science of making intelligent machines".

The algorithms has been here since then. AI is more interesting now because:

* Computing power has not been strong enough
* Computer storage has not been large enough
* Big data has not been available
* Fast Internet has not been available

Another strong force is the major investments from big companies (Google, Microsoft, Facebook, YouTube) because their datasets became much too big to handle traditionally.

### **Intelligent Decision Formula**

* Save the result of all actions
* Simulate all possible outcomes
* Compare the new action with the old ones
* Check if the new action is good or bad
* Choose the new action if it is less bad
* Do it all over again

The fact that computers can do this millions of times, has proven that computers can take very intelligent decisions.
