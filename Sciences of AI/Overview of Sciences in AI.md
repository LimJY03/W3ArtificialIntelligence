# **Overview of Sciences in AI**

**Artificial Intelligence** is a set of different **Sciences**:

* Machine Learning (ML)
* Neural Networks (NN)
* Deep Learning (DL)
* Big Data

## **01. AI Scientists**

AI Scientists build software with algorithms that can do tasks that normally require human intelligence.

AI Scientists can be experts in multiple AI disciplines:

* Applied mathematics
* Computational statistics
* Computer Science
* Machine learning
* Deep learning

Some AI Scientists also have significant big data experience:

* Business Intelligence
* Data Base Design
* Data Warehouse Design
* Data Mining
* SQL Queries
* SQL Reporting

### **The Deep Learning Revolution**

The deep learning revolution started around 2010. Since then, Deep Learning has been used to solve many "unsolvable" problems.

**01. Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)**

> Deep CNNs such as [ResNeta](https://www.cv-foundation.org/openaccess/content_cvpr_2016/html/He_Deep_Residual_Learning_CVPR_2016_paper.html) and [Inception](https://www.cv-foundation.org/openaccess/content_cvpr_2015/html/Szegedy_Going_Deeper_With_2015_CVPR_paper.html) have reduced the error rate in the **ImageNet** classification from 25% in 2011 to 5% in 2017.
> 
> **ImageNe**t is an image database organized according to the WordNet hierarchy, in which each node of the hierarchy contains hundreds and thousands of images. ImageNet is a useful resource for researchers, educators, students and everyone else with a passion for pictures.
> 
> **WordNet** is a lexical database of semantic relations between words in 200+ languages. It is organized as a combination of a dictionary and thesaurus, linking words together into semantic relations using synonyms, hyponyms, and meronyms.

**02. Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs)**
