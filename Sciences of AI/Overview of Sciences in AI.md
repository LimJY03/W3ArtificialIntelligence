# **Overview of Sciences in AI**

**Artificial Intelligence** is a set of different **Sciences**:

* Machine Learning (ML)
* Neural Networks (NN)
* Deep Learning (DL)
* Big Data

## **01. AI Scientists**

AI Scientists build software with algorithms that can do tasks that normally require human intelligence.

AI Scientists can be experts in multiple AI disciplines:

* Applied mathematics
* Computational statistics
* Computer Science
* Machine learning
* Deep learning

Some AI Scientists also have significant big data experience:

* Business Intelligence
* Data Base Design
* Data Warehouse Design
* Data Mining
* SQL Queries
* SQL Reporting

### **The Deep Learning Revolution**

The deep learning revolution started around 2010. Since then, Deep Learning has been used to solve many "unsolvable" problems.

**01. Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)**

> Deep CNNs such as [ResNeta](https://www.cv-foundation.org/openaccess/content_cvpr_2016/html/He_Deep_Residual_Learning_CVPR_2016_paper.html) and [Inception](https://www.cv-foundation.org/openaccess/content_cvpr_2015/html/Szegedy_Going_Deeper_With_2015_CVPR_paper.html) have reduced the error rate in the **ImageNet** classification from 25% in 2011 to 5% in 2017.

> **ImageNe**t is an image database organized according to the WordNet hierarchy, in which each node of the hierarchy contains hundreds and thousands of images. ImageNet is a useful resource for researchers, educators, students and everyone else with a passion for pictures.
> 
> **WordNet** is a lexical database of semantic relations between words in 200+ languages. It is organized as a combination of a dictionary and thesaurus, linking words together into semantic relations using synonyms, hyponyms, and meronyms.

**02. Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs)**

## **Data in AI**

Up to **80%** of a Machine Learning project is about **Collecting Data**:

* What data is Required?
* What data is Available?
* How to Select the data?
* How to Collect the data?
* How to Clean the data?
* How to Prepare the data?
* How to Use the data?

### **What is Data?**

Data can be many things. With Machine Learning, it is a collection of facts.

| Type | Examples |
| :--- | :--- |
| Numbers | Prices, Dates |
| Measurements | Size, Height, Weight |
| Words | Names, Places |
| Observations | Counting Cars | 
| Descriptions | It is cold |

### **Intelligence Needs Data**

Human intelligence needs data:

* A real estate broker needs data about sold houses to estimate prices.

Artificial Intelligence also needs data:

* A Machine Learning program needs data to estimate prices.

### **Storing Data**

The most common data to collect are **Numbers** and **Measurements**.

Often data are stored in arrays representing the relationship between values.

### **Qualitative Data vs Quantitative Data**

Quantitative data are numerical:

* 55 cars
* 15 meters
* 35 children

Qualitative data are descriptive:

* It is cold
* It is long
* It was fun

### **Sampling Terms**

A **Population** is group of individuals (objects) we want to collect information from.

A **Census** is information about every individual in a population.

A **Sample** is information about a part of the population. (in order to represent all)

* If we wanted to know how many Americans smoke cigarettes, we could ask every person in the US (a census), or we could ask 10 000 people (a sample).

* A census is **Accurate**, but hard to do. A sample is **Inaccurate**, but is easier to do.

### **Random Samples**

In order for a sample to represent a population, it must be collected randomly.

A **Random Sample** is a sample where every member of the population has an equal chance to appear in the sample.

A **Sampling Bias** (Error) occurs when samples are collected in such a way that some individuals are less (or more) likely to be included in the sample.
