## **01. What is AI?**

Artificial Intelligence is a contrast to Human Intelligence.

### **What is Artificial Intelligence?**

Artificial Intelligence suggests that machines can mimic humans in:

* Talking
* Thinking
* Learning
* Planning
* Understanding

Artificial Intelligence is also called Machine Intelligence and Computer Intelligence.

**w3schools.com Definition of AI**
> Artificial intelligence is a system that can solve a problem optimally. This means that the system can figure out alone what is the best action to take.

**Wikipedia Definition of AI**
> AI is intelligence demonstrated by machines, unlike natural intelligence displayed by humans and animals, which involves consciousness and emotionality.

**Investopedia Definition of AI**
> AI refers to the simulation of human intelligence in machines that are programmed to think like humans and mimic their actions.

**Britannica Definition of AI**
> AI is the ability of a digital computer or computer-controlled robot to perform tasks commonly associated with intelligent beings. The term is frequently applied to the project of developing systems endowed with the intellectual processes characteristic of humans, such as the ability to reason, discover meaning, generalize, or learn from past experience.

### **Why AI Now?**

One of the greatest innovators in the field of machine learning was John McCarthy, widely recognized as the "Father of Artificial Intelligence".

In the mid 1950s, McCarthy coined the term "Artificial Intelligence" and defined it as "the science of making intelligent machines".

The algorithms has been here since then. AI is more interesting now because:

* Computing power has not been strong enough
* Computer storage has not been large enough
* Big data has not been available
* Fast Internet has not been available

Another strong force is the major investments from big companies (Google, Microsoft, Facebook, YouTube) because their datasets became much too big to handle traditionally.

### **Intelligent Decision Formula**

* Save the result of all actions
* Simulate all possible outcomes
* Compare the new action with the old ones
* Check if the new action is good or bad
* Choose the new action if it is less bad
* Do it all over again

The fact that computers can do this millions of times, has proven that computers can take very intelligent decisions.

## **02. Human Intelligence**

About 70 000 years ago, something happened to the human brain.

Humans started to develop "Cognitive Intelligence":

* Being able to understand a language
* Being able to understand numbers
* Being able to understand abstract thinking

### **Words and Numbers**

Using words, was a big step in the development of human intelligence:
> "Elephant" is more informative than "Big Animal".

Understanding numbers, was also a big step:
> "5" or "50" is more informative than "few" or "many".

### **Languages**

Having a language is probably a key characteristic that distinguishes us from animals.
> "There is a lion behind the big oak" is more informative than shouting "Danger!".

### **Abstract Thinking**

Abstract thinking is the thinking about things that are not concrete, like freedom, or ideas, or concepts.

> **CONCRETE**
> * Mouth
> * Fingertip
> * One apple
> * Two chicken
> * Three horses

> **ABSTRACT**
> * Freedom
> * The past
> * The future
> * Imagination
> * Explanation

Many everyday behaviors use abstract thinking:

* Using Concepts
* Using Theories
* Using Metaphors
* Using Analogies
* Using Imagination

### **What is Intelligence?**

There is no proven definition of Intelligence.

Intelligence can be defined as:

* Being able to understand abstract thinking
* Being able to understand a language
* Being able to understand numbers

Intelligence can be defined as a collection of knowledge:

> *"Intelligence could be defined as the process of obtaining knowledge by efficient means."*
> 
> Yampolsky (2013)

The challenge of AI is to understand what intelligence is, and how intelligence works.

Intelligence might be a type of algorithms in our brains or in our genes.

### **Is the Human Brain Superior?**

Can animals, birds, insects, or plants think?

Humans have bigger brains than animals.

Big dogs have bigger brains than small dogs. Are big dogs smarter?

Birds have very small brains, but they know they should not make children in the autumn, and they know when to fly to the south.

Bees have even smaller brains, but they know how to communicate about where to find nectar.

Plants have no brain, but they know how to reproduce, and how to prepare for the winter.

---

## **03. The History of Languages**

A language is a structured system of communication that involves the use of words.

### **What is a Language**

* Apes and Whales communicate with each other.
* Birds and Bees communicate with each other.
* But only humans have developed a real Language.

No other species can express ideas using sentences constructed by a set of words (with verbs and nouns).

This skill is remarkable. And what is even more remarkable: Even children master this skill.

### **Spoken Language**

We are not sure of how old the spoken language is. The topic is difficult to study because of the lack of evidence.

We don't know how it started. But we have a clue.

> The great African apes, Pan and Gorilla, are our closest living relatives. Why are they called "Apes"? Because they ape. Apes mime to get their message across.

It is assumed that the evolution of languages must have been a long process. Our ancestors might have started speaking a million years ago, but with fewer words, more miming, and no grammar.

### **Cognitive Development**

According to [Hauser, Chomsky, and Fitch (2002)](https://www.science.org/doi/abs/10.1126/science.298.5598.1569), there are six aspects of language development:

* Theory of Mind
* Understanding Vocal Signals
* Understanding Imitation
* Understanding Numbers
* Understanding Intentional Communication
* Understanding Non-linguistic Representations

### **Human Languages**

Human languages contain a limited set of **Words** put together in **Sentences**:
> `[EN]` I'm going on holiday in my new car.
>
> `[IT]` Vado in vacanza con la mia macchina nuova.
> 
> `[ES]` Me voy de vacaciones en mi auto nuevo.
> 
> `[DE]` Ich fahre mit meinem neuen Auto in den Urlaub.

### **Computer Languages**

Computers are programmed with a limited set of Words put together in computer Statements:

    var points = [40, 100, 1, 5, 25, 10]; 
    points.sort(function(a, b){return a - b});

### **Written Languages**

Egyptian (3000 BC) and Sumerian (3500 BC) are the earliest known written languages.

The oldest written language still in use today, is Chinese (1500 BC - now).

## **04. The History of Numbers**

To understand AI, it is important to understand the concept of Numbers and Counting.

### **AI is About Numbers**

Artificial Intelligence is all about Numbers.

Numbers are easy to understand: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 ... 11, 12, 13, 14, 15.

Studies of animals indicates that even animals can understand some numbers:

* 2 Parents
* 8 Childrens
* 5 Eggs

The need for numbers in the modern world is absolute. We cannot live without numbers:

* 100 Dollar
* Pi = 3.14
* 365 Days
* 25 Years
* 20% Tax
* 100 Miles

### **AI is About Counting**

The concept of numbers leads to the concept of counting.

Imagine prehistoric thinking:

* How to count apples?
* How to weigh corn?
* How to pay?
* How far is the ocean?

Artificial Intelligence is a result of the human need for calculations.

Counting is easy to understand: 2 + 2 = 4.

Studies of animals indicates that animals can only understand very simple counting.

How do Homo Sapiens deal with calculations?

Complex calculations are done by computers.
> Computers can be smarter than humans. 

### **Two Babylonian Scientists**

About 6000 years ago, two Babylonian scientists were talking:

> Scientist 1: "We need to invent a number system."
>
> Scientist 2: "What?"
>
> Scientist 1: "We need to give every number a name."
>
> Scientist 2: "You mean like 1, 2, and 3?"
> 
> Scientist 1: "Exactly!"
>
> Scientist 2: "But why?"
> 
> Scientist 1: "How can I tell you I have 7 sons, if you don't know what 7 is?"
> 
> Scientist 2: "Every number should have a name?"
>
> Scientist 1: "Exactly!"
>
> Scientist 2: "So, how many numbers do we need? 15?"
>
> Scientist 1: "More. Some people have more than 15 sons."
>
> Scientist 2: "Ok. 30 then. Just to be sure."
> 
> Scientist 1: "But people older than 30 should be able to tell their age."
> 
> Scientist 2: "Ok. 60 then."

### **Babylonian Numbers (Base 60)**

We believe that the Babylonians started the development of complex counting.

![Babylonian Numerals](https://www.w3schools.com/ai/img_babylonian_numerals.jpg)

The Babylonian number system has 60 different digits. It is a Base 60 system:

> 1, 5 means 1 * 60 + 5 * 1 = 65
> 
> 3, 30 means 3 * 60 + 30 * 1 = 210

The Babylonians had a place-value system, where the digits to in the left represented full values, much like our decimal system.

The reason why the Babylonians used 60 as the base, was (we like to believe) that 60 is divisible with most numbers: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 10, 12, 15, 20, 30 and 60.

The downside was that the user had to remember 60 different digits. But the system was smart. A lot of it is still in use today:
> 1 hour: 1 * 60 = 60 minutes

### **Sexagesimal (Base 60)**

The origin of the **Sexagesimal system (base 60)** has been lost in history.

But surely, it looks like it has been used in parallel with the **Dozenal system (Base 12)** since ancient times.

The sexagesimal system (base 60):

* There are 60 seconds in one minute
* There are 60 minutes in one hour

60 is very versatile. It can be divided by 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 10, 12, 15, 30 and 60.

### **Dozenal (Base 12)**

The dozenal system (base 12):

* There are 12 in a dozen
* There are 12 hours in a day
* There are 12 hours in a night
* There are 12 months in a year

12 is very versatile. It can be divided by 1, 2, 3, 4, 6 and 12.

### **Roman Numbers (Base 10)**

Roman numbers originated in Rome and was used in Europe into the Middle Ages.

> `I` -> 1
> 
> `V` -> 5
> 
> `X` -> 10
> 
> `L` -> 50
> 
> `C` -> 100
> 
> `D` -> 500
> 
> `M` -> 1000

The Romans used a Base 10 system. Possibly because they used their 10 fingers to count.

Today, most of the world use a Base 10 number system:
> Western numbers, Chinese numbers, Brahmi numbers, Greek numbers, Hebrew numbers...

### **Digital Numbers**

Humans can count with base 10 numbers, computers can not.

Electricity cannot count. Electricity can only be On and Off.

Computers use Electricity or Magnetism to represent On and Off.

> Computers use Digital Numbers like 11100110 (in contrast to Base 10 Numbers like 230).

Digital numbers (11100110) are also called Binary Numbers.

### **Computer vs. Human**

Computers can handle an unlimited amount of numbers. But, humans can not.

## **The History of Computing**

### **The First Abacus**

The Babylonian Abacus was developed to **Reduce the Time** to perform calculations.

As stated in the previous chapter, we believe that the Babylonians invented complex counting.

The period 2700–2300 BC probably saw the first appearance of an abacus, a table of successive columns which defined the orders of a 60-digits number system.

### **Abacus 2.0**

The Roman Abacus used 10-digits Roman numbers to **Reduce the Time** to perform calculations:

![Abacus 2.0](https://www.w3schools.com/ai/img_roman_abacus.jpg)

The Romans developed the Roman Abacus, a portable, base-10 version of earlier abacuses used by the Babylonians.

This was the worlds first handheld computer. Used by Roman engineers, merchants and tax collectors.

### **Analog Computers**

**The Difference Engine** (Charles Babbage 1822) was a mechanical machine designed to **Reduce the Time** to calculate complex mathematical functions.

**The Analytical Engine** (Charles Babbage 1833) was a mechanical machine designed with modern computer elements like arithmetic, logic and memory.

Both of these "computers" used 10-digits (decimal) mechanical cogwheels to perform mathematical calculations.

![Charles Babbage's Analytical Engine. Science Museum. London](https://www.w3schools.com/ai/img_analytical_machine.jpg)

### **Digital Computers**

Digital Computers use 0 / 1 switches to perform calculations. They operate on binary values like 11100110 in contrast to analog values like 230.

The first Electric Digital Computer was designed and built by Konrad Zuse in Germany (1941).

It used 2600 electrical relays as 0 / 1 switches. The clock speed was about 5 Hz.

![Replica of the Zuse Z3. Deutsches Museum. Munich.](https://www.w3schools.com/ai/img_z3_zuse.jpg)

### **Electronic Computers**

First Generation Computers (1945-1950) used vacuum tubes as binary switches.

> Vacuum tubes are much faster than electrical relays.
> 
> The clock speed of these computers was between 500 KHz and 1 Mhz.
> 
> ![First Generation Computers](https://www.w3schools.com/ai/img_vacuum_tubes.jpg)

Second generation Computers (1950-1960) used transistors as binary 0 / 1 switches.

> Transistors are much faster than vacuum tubes.
>
> ![Second Generation Computers](https://www.w3schools.com/ai/img_computer_transistors.jpg)

Third generation Computers (1960) used integrated circuits as binary switches.

> Integrated circuits are much faster than transistors.
>
> ![Third Generation Computers](https://www.w3schools.com/ai/img_integrated_circuits.jpg)

### **Computer Speed**

The first electrical computer could do 5 instructions per second.

The first electronic computer did 5000 instructions per second.

The first PC did 5 million instructions per second.

AMD was the first PC to reach 1 billion instructions per second.

Today, IPhone 12 can do 11 billion instructions per second.

### **Where Did it Start and Where Will it End?**

From the history above you can extract:

* Computers were designed to do calculations
* Charles Babbage created the first mechanical computer
* The first digital computers used electromechanical switches
* Vacuum tubes are much faster than electromechanical switches
* Transistors are much faster than vacuum tubes
* Integrated circuits are much faster than transistors
* Tomorrow's computes will be faster than the human brain?

> *"Computers are useless because they can only give you answers."*
>
> Pablo Picasso

### **Computers are Smarter than Humans?**

If we believe in [Moores Law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moore%27s_law):

In 2020, computers have the capacity of a mouse brain.

In 2030, computers might have the capacity of a human brain:
